## Activities:

- _AllTests.java_: Contains the use of _@SuiteClasses_ annotation to combine several test cases
int a suite of tests.

- _AssertTests.java_: Contains a few commonly used assertions. It is not an exhausted list. For 
more information on that consider this reference [page](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/javadoc/1.3/index.html?org/hamcrest/CoreMatchers.html "CoreMatchers").

- _CalculatorTest.java_: Contains basic tests using _Parameterized_ class. This shows you how to tests multiple cases with a collection of data. Use 'expected' parameter in @Test for exception handler.
